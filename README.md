# A protoc plugin to generate source code from proto files

## Background

When we come up with an idea and want to make a minimal demo, we will do many works, such as model definition, data management, state management, server side staffs and so on. What this project aims to do is to accelerate the demo making progress. The core principle is that you only need to define the data model and build the UIs, the others should all be generated by this plugin.

## What in it

* db source code: currently we use isar as the backend
* client state management: currently use bloc
* server side code: gprc and glue code to db
* client side code: grpc and glue code to data model and state management code

## How to use

* STEP1 : compile the exe file

```
dart compile exe bin/protoc_plugin_isar.dart
```

* STEP2 : a very protoc styled call just like following (if want to generate isar code, just include the `isar` option in the out parameter)

```
protoc --proto_path test/ test.proto --isar_out=isar:out --plugin=protoc-gen-isar=bin/protoc_plugin_isar.exe
```
