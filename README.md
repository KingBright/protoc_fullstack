# A protoc plugin to generate source code from proto files

## Why doing thisï¼Ÿ

When we come up with an idea and want to make a minimal demo, we will do many works, such as model definition, data management, state management, server side stuffs and so on. What this project aims to do is to accelerate the demo making progress. The core principle is that you only need to define the data model, build the UIs and complete your special stuffs based on the skeleton codes, the others should all be generated by this plugin.

## What in it

* database related code: currently we use [isar](https://isar.dev/) as the db backend
* client state management & business logics : currently use [bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/)
* client side code: grpc and glue code to data model and state management code
* server side code: grpc and glue code to db

## How to use (deprecated: should update later)

* STEP1 : compile the exe file

```
dart compile exe bin/protoc_plugin_fullstack.dart
```

* STEP2 : a very protoc styled call just like following (actually this project is just a plugin of protoc)

```
protoc --proto_path test/ test.proto --fs_out=fs:out --plugin=protoc-gen-fullstack=bin/protoc_plugin_fullstack.exe
```
